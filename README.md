# data-log-anal


monitor, log, and use real-world data values in a Python program, we follow these steps. 
Below is an outline for a py script with a focus on data collection, logging, & analysis:

Data Collection: This could involve reading from a file, a database, or even real-time data collection from sensors or APIs.

Logging: Store the collected data in a log file for future reference and analysis.

Data Analysis: Use statistical methods to analyze the logged data.

The first script assumes you are reading data from a CSV file, logging it, and then performing statistical analysis. 

Adjustments will be made to other versions for specific data sources / requirements.
